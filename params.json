  "body": "# CodePush\r\n\r\n[CodePush](https://microsoft.github.io/code-push) is a cloud service that enables Cordova and React Native developers to deploy mobile app updates directly to their users' devices. It works by acting as a central repository that developers can publish updates to (JS, HTML, CSS and images), and that apps can query for updates from (using provided client SDKs for [Cordova](https://github.com/Microsoft/cordova-plugin-code-push) and [React Native](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push)). This allows you to have a more deterministic and direct engagement model with your userbase, when addressing bugs and/or adding small features that don't require you to re-build a binary and re-distribute it through the respective app stores.\r\n\r\nThis repo includes the [management CLI](https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/tree/master/cli) and [Node.js management SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push/tree/master/sdk), which allows you to manage and automate the needs of your Cordova and React Native apps. To get started using CodePush, refer to our [documentation](http://microsoft.github.io/code-push/index.html#getting_started), otherwise, read the following steps if you'd like to build/contribute to the project from source.\r\n\r\n## Dev Setup\r\n\r\n* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)\r\n* Install [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/)\r\n* Install Gulp: `npm install -g gulp`\r\n* Clone the Repository: `git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/code-push.git`\r\n\r\n### Building\r\n\r\n* Run `npm install` from the root of the repository.\r\n* Run `gulp install` to install the NPM dependencies of each module within the project.\r\n* Run `gulp link` to link CLI and SDK for local development. It is advisable to do this step if you are making changes to the SDK and want the CLI to pick those changes.\r\n* Run `gulp build` to build all of the modules. To build just one of the modules (e.g. cli or sdk), run `gulp build-cli` or `gulp build-sdk`.\r\n\r\n### Running Tests\r\n\r\nTo run all tests, run `gulp test` script from the root of the project.\r\n\r\nTo test just one of the projects (e.g. cli or sdk), run `gulp test-cli` or `gulp test-sdk`\r\n\r\n### Coding Conventions\r\n\r\n* Use double quotes for strings\r\n* Use four space tabs\r\n* Use `camelCase` for local variables and imported modules, `PascalCase` for types, and `dash-case` for file names\r\n\r\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
